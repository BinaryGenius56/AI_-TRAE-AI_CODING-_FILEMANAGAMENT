# Security Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security implementation plan for the Hospital Network Management System, focusing on end-to-end encryption, access control, and regulatory compliance.

## Encryption Strategy

### Data at Rest

- **Database Encryption**: Implement transparent data encryption (TDE) for PostgreSQL databases using AES-256 encryption.
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, insurance information) will use column-level encryption with separate encryption keys.
- **Document Storage**: All documents stored in S3-compatible storage will be encrypted using server-side encryption with AES-256.
- **Key Management**: Utilize a dedicated key management service (KMS) to securely store and manage encryption keys.

### Data in Transit

- **TLS 1.2+**: All API communications will use TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suites.
- **Certificate Management**: Implement automated certificate rotation and monitoring.
- **API Gateway**: Configure the API Gateway to enforce HTTPS-only connections.
- **VPN/MPLS**: Ensure all hospital-to-hospital communications over the network backbone are encrypted.

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**:
  - System Administrator
  - Hospital Administrator
  - Physician
  - Nurse
  - Pharmacist
  - Lab Technician
  - Radiologist
  - Medical Records Staff
  - Patient

- **Permission Sets**:
  - View Patient Demographics
  - View Medical Records
  - Create/Edit Medical Records
  - View Medications
  - Prescribe Medications
  - View Documents
  - Upload Documents
  - Process Documents with AI
  - Manage Consents
  - System Configuration

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- **Contextual Attributes**:
  - Time of day
  - Location
  - Device type
  - Network type
  - Patient relationship (treating physician, etc.)
  - Emergency status

- **Policy Enforcement**:
  - Centralized policy decision point (PDP)
  - Policy enforcement points (PEP) at API Gateway and service levels
  - Regular policy audits and reviews

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Required for all administrative access
- Optional but recommended for clinical staff
- Support for various second factors:
  - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
  - Push notifications to mobile devices
  - Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)

## Audit Logging

### Immutable Audit Trails

- **Log Storage**: Write-once-read-many (WORM) storage for all audit logs
- **Log Content**:
  - User ID
  - Action type
  - Resource accessed
  - Timestamp with secure time source
  - Source IP and device information
  - Success/failure status
  - Changes made (before/after values)

### Log Management

- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all system components
- **Log Retention**: Minimum 7-year retention period for compliance
- **Log Protection**: Encryption and integrity verification for all logs
- **Log Analysis**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities

## Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- **Data Subject Rights**:
  - Right to access
  - Right to rectification
  - Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
  - Right to restrict processing
  - Right to data portability
  - Right to object

- **Implementation**:
  - Consent management system
  - Data processing records
  - Data protection impact assessments
  - Breach notification procedures

### Data Residency

- **Data Localization**:
  - Regional deployment options
  - Data storage location tracking
  - Cross-border transfer controls

## Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Threat Detection

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**:
  - Log correlation and analysis
  - Anomaly detection
  - Threat intelligence integration

- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**:
  - Network-based detection
  - Host-based detection
  - API abuse detection

### Vulnerability Management

- **Regular Scanning**:
  - Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Dependency analysis
  - Configuration auditing

- **Penetration Testing**:
  - Annual third-party penetration tests
  - Quarterly internal security assessments
  - Continuous security validation

## Incident Response

### Response Plan

- **Incident Classification**:
  - Data breach
  - Unauthorized access
  - Service disruption
  - Malware/ransomware

- **Response Team**:
  - Security lead
  - Technical responders
  - Legal counsel
  - Communications team
  - Executive sponsor

- **Response Procedures**:
  - Detection and analysis
  - Containment
  - Eradication
  - Recovery
  - Post-incident analysis

### Breach Notification

- **Notification Timelines**:
  - HIPAA: 60 days
  - GDPR: 72 hours
  - State laws: Varies

- **Notification Content**:
  - Description of breach
  - Types of information involved
  - Steps individuals should take
  - Mitigation measures taken
  - Contact information
