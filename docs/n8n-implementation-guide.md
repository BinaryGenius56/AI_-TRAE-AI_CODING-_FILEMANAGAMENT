# n8n Implementation Guide for Hospital Network Management System

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing n8n workflow automation with the Hospital Network Management System. It covers installation, configuration, security considerations, and example implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or later
- npm 6.x or later
- Access to Hospital Network Management System API endpoints
- Administrative privileges for system configuration

## Installation

### 1. Install n8n

```bash
# Install n8n globally
npm install n8n -g

# Or use Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your n8n installation directory with the following variables:

```
# Hospital Network Management System API Configuration
HOSPITAL_API_URL=https://api.hospital-network.org
HOSPITAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Hospital Endpoints (comma-separated list of hospitalId|baseUrl pairs)
HOSPITAL_ENDPOINTS=hospital1|https://hospital1.org,hospital2|https://hospital2.org

# Monitoring Configuration
CENTRAL_MONITORING_URL=https://monitoring.hospital-network.org
DASHBOARD_API_URL=https://dashboard.hospital-network.org

# Email Configuration
PHARMACY_EMAIL=pharmacy@hospital-network.org

# Security Configuration
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here
```

## Security Setup

### 1. Configure Authentication

Set up API key authentication for n8n to securely communicate with the Hospital Network Management System:

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **Credentials**
2. Click **New Credential**
3. Select **HTTP Header Auth**
4. Enter the following details:
   - Name: Hospital API Auth
   - Authentication Type: Header Auth
   - Name: X-API-Key
   - Value: your_api_key_here

### 2. Enable Encryption

Ensure all sensitive data in workflows is encrypted:

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Enable **Encryption**
3. Set a strong encryption key

### 3. Configure Access Control

Implement role-based access control for n8n:

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **Users**
2. Create user accounts with appropriate roles:
   - Administrators: Full access to create and modify workflows
   - Operators: Execute workflows but cannot modify them
   - Viewers: View workflow execution results only

## Implementing Example Workflows

### Medication Inventory Workflow

1. In n8n, go to **Workflows** > **New**
2. Click **Import from File**
3. Select the `medication-inventory-workflow.json` file from the `sample-n8n-workflows` directory
4. Configure the webhook endpoint URL in your barcode scanning application to point to the n8n webhook URL
5. Update the credential references to use your Hospital API Auth credential

### System Health Monitoring Workflow

1. In n8n, go to **Workflows** > **New**
2. Click **Import from File**
3. Select the `system-health-monitoring-workflow.json` file from the `sample-n8n-workflows` directory
4. Update the `HOSPITAL_ENDPOINTS` environment variable with your hospital endpoints
5. Configure the schedule to run at your desired interval
6. Update the credential references to use your Hospital API Auth credential

## Creating Custom Nodes

For hospital-specific functionality, you may need to create custom n8n nodes:

1. Create a new directory for your custom node:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.n8n/custom/nodes/hospital-nodes
cd ~/.n8n/custom/nodes/hospital-nodes
npm init -y
```

2. Install n8n node development dependencies:

```bash
npm install n8n-core n8n-workflow --save
```

3. Create a node implementation file (e.g., `FhirNode.node.ts`) with your custom functionality

4. Build and register your custom node

5. Restart n8n to load your custom node

## Integration with Hospital Network Management System

### API Gateway Integration

To integrate n8n with the Hospital Network Management System's API Gateway:

1. Configure the API Gateway to allow requests from n8n's IP address
2. Set up rate limiting rules appropriate for automated workflows
3. Ensure proper authentication is configured for all API endpoints

### Audit Trail Integration

Ensure all n8n workflow executions are properly logged in the hospital's audit system:

1. Include audit logging steps in all workflows that modify patient or hospital data
2. Use the Hospital Network Management System's Audit API to log events
3. Include relevant details such as the workflow name, execution ID, and affected resources

## Monitoring n8n

Set up monitoring for your n8n instance:

1. Configure health checks for the n8n service
2. Set up alerts for failed workflow executions
3. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) of the n8n server
4. Implement log aggregation for n8n execution logs

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

Implement a backup strategy for your n8n instance:

1. Regularly export all workflows as JSON files
2. Back up the n8n database (typically SQLite or PostgreSQL)
3. Document the recovery procedure in case of system failure
4. Test the recovery procedure periodically

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Store workflow JSON files in a version control system
2. **Testing**: Create test environments for workflows before deploying to production
3. **Documentation**: Document each workflow's purpose, inputs, outputs, and dependencies
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in all workflows
5. **Idempotency**: Design workflows to be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
6. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for workflow failures
7. **Security**: Regularly review workflow security and access controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify API keys are correctly configured
   - Check that the API key has not expired
   - Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions

2. **Webhook Issues**:
   - Verify the webhook URL is accessible from the source system
   - Check for firewall or network restrictions
   - Ensure the webhook is properly registered in n8n

3. **Performance Problems**:
   - Monitor workflow execution times
   - Optimize database queries in workflows
   - Consider scaling n8n horizontally for high-volume workflows

## Conclusion

By following this implementation guide, you can successfully integrate n8n with the Hospital Network Management System to automate workflows, improve efficiency, and enhance system monitoring capabilities.
