## Component Details

### Network Infrastructure

- **Private VPN/MPLS Backbone**: Secure network connecting all participating hospitals
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for all API requests with authentication, authorization, and auditing

### Communication Layer

- **Protocol Support**: HL7 FHIR for structured EHR data, DICOM for imaging studies
- **Message Broker**: Event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ or Kafka for real-time synchronization
- **Data Consistency**: Periodic checksums and delta synchronization for reliability

### Core Services

#### Patient Records Service

- Patient-centric health record management
- OAuth2-style consent mechanism
- Cross-hospital record access with temporary tokens
- Translation/mapping layer for interoperability

#### Medication Management Service

- Standardized medication data model (RxNorm/SNOMED CT)
- Barcode/QR scanning integration (GS1 standard)
- Inventory tracking and auditing

#### Document Service

- Secure document upload and storage
- Versioning and preview capabilities
- AI-powered validation and cross-checking
- Tagging and search functionality

### Data Storage

- **PostgreSQL Database**: For structured data with full-text search and JSONB support
- **S3-compatible Object Storage**: For encrypted document storage
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: For compliance and security tracking

### Security Layer

- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit
- **Access Control**: RBAC/ABAC models
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security analytics

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **Web**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Mobile**: React Native or Flutter

### Backend

- **API Services**: Node.js (Express/Fastify) or Python (FastAPI/Django REST)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible encrypted storage

### AI/Automation

- **Document Processing**: OCR and validation pipelines
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML models for identifying data issues

## Deployment Architecture

The system supports both on-premises and hybrid cloud deployment models, with the following considerations:

- Each hospital can maintain local instances of core services
- Shared services can be deployed in a secure cloud environment
- Data residency requirements must be considered for compliance

## Scalability and Redundancy

- Horizontal scaling of services based on load
- Database replication and failover
- Geographic redundancy for critical components
- Load balancing across service instances
