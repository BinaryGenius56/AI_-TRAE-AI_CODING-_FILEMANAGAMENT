# n8n Integration Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation and examples for integrating n8n workflow automation with the Hospital Network Management System.

## Contents

- [n8n Integration Overview](./n8n-integration.md) - Comprehensive documentation on how n8n can be integrated across different modules of the hospital system
- [Integration Architecture Diagram](./n8n-integration-diagram.svg) - Visual representation of how n8n connects with various system components
- [Sample Workflows](./sample-n8n-workflows/) - Example n8n workflow configurations for common hospital automation scenarios

## Sample Workflows

The `sample-n8n-workflows` directory contains JSON configuration files that can be imported directly into n8n:

- **Medication Inventory Workflow** - Automates medication tracking through barcode scanning, inventory updates, and low stock alerts
- **System Health Monitoring Workflow** - Regularly checks the health of hospital system components and sends alerts for any issues

## Getting Started

1. Install n8n in your environment:
   ```
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

2. Configure n8n with the appropriate credentials for your Hospital Network Management System

3. Import the sample workflows from the `sample-n8n-workflows` directory

4. Customize the workflows to match your specific hospital configuration

## Security Considerations

When implementing n8n workflows for healthcare data:

- Ensure all n8n instances are deployed in secure environments
- Use encrypted credentials for all API connections
- Implement proper authentication for all webhook endpoints
- Enable audit logging for all workflow executions
- Regularly review workflow security and access controls
